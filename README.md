# Cegep Computer Setup Script
This is a script originally created by one of my friends. In his own words, he describes it as:

" A script to automatically setup CEM computers with my preferred settings. Far from perfect, but it works."

I've customized it to suit my preferences and have been using it ever since.

If you're a student at CEM, I highly recommend using this script or my friend script. 
It's been tailored to automate the setup of CEM computers with personalized settings, 
making it a handy tool for streamlining your computing experience. Ajust it to you're
own preferences.
